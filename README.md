Tonestra is the healthcare
and biometric blockchain project that is poised to transform information
sharing and record keeping in healthcare industry. This will cover such areas
as pharmaceuticals, medicinal research, genome technology, nursing science and
the whole ecosystem of biotechnology. Blockchain technology has found a lot of
useful application in many areas of human endeavor and health sciences is one
of such areas. Tonestra offers the first complete blockchain healthcare project
where scientist and healthcare receivers can have their data securely stored for
utilization by healthcare practitioners. This  platform will provide a veritable system where
pharmaceutical industries, healthcare NGO’s, patient affirmative action support
agencies, hospitals, drug development companies  and insurance businesses all can interact for
the advancement of health science and business. Also genomics and biometric
companies can utilize the platform in sequencing and storage of scientific data
for continuous research development and improvement for humanity. This will
prove extremely useful in the advancement of research and development of
knowledge  in such gene diseases as cancer,
Alzheimer’s, autism, lou gherig disease and a host of other diseases that are enshrined
in the human genes, including a number of congenital birth defects.

The Tonestra token,
TNR will be the dynamic currency fuel payment unit which will power the system
platform.  The tokens will be attached to
data storage and in transmitting information across the Tonestra network and
ecosystem.  Five million Tonestra TNR
tokens shall be created and traded on major cryptocurrency exchanges.  The Tonestra platform shall provide the
largest healthcare technology and medical science data storage system where
contributors will have absolute control over how they can utilize the stored data
for their financial benefits. The business and research potential is limitless.
Tonestra will have an underpinning artificial intelligence research based
methodology which will use machine learning techniques in developing and
sharing information for all contributors. The use of Blockchain technology distributed
ledger system will ensure reliability of the systems, personalized
authentication and very importantly engender the elimination of trust problems amongst
users.  A cryptographic key generator is
used in generating keys utilizing assymetric algorithm and permission based
smart contract. Contributors will have control over their private keys and will
only grant access to users who have been pre-approved through an authentication
process. The use of the platform will enable healthcare providers and drug
development companies to identify the best course of medical regiment for the
treatment of a patient, prevention of diseases in healthy population,
prediction of possible outbreaks and mutation, disease diagnosis, prognosis and
identification of possible new drug type for treatment 

 

The Tonestra
platform will have the following features:

 

Healthcare data contributors own absolute right to their data and how
they use itContributors gain financial benefits by providing access to industry
users, such as biotechnoly research companies and medicinal drug developers for
a paymentThe development of an ecosystem where all users continuously work for
the development of the platform for the benefit of all
